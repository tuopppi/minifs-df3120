minifs-df3120 -- Compact Linux Distro Generator
=============

*minifs-df3120* is forked from buserror-uk/minifs repository. My version 
has stripped all but df3120 section and adds some additional functionality. 

*minifs-df3120* is intended to run on [Parrot df3120 picture frame](https://sites.google.com/site/repurposelinux/df3120).

This repo also includes Uli Fuchs' patches from ufuchs/parrot-df3120_post-hoc to silince kernel errors, thanks
